## Write Java programs for the following:

1. Taking a matrix as an input and printing its elements.
2. Searching for an element x in a matrix.
3. Print the spiral order matrix as output for a given matrix of numbers. [Difficult for Beginners]
    |  1  |  5  |  7  |  9  | 10  | 11  |
    |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
    |  6  | 10  | 12  | 13  | 20  | 21  |
    |  9  | 25  | 29  | 30  | 32  | 41  |
    | 15  | 55  | 59  | 63  | 68  | 70  |
    | 40  | 70  | 79  | 81  | 95  | 105 |
Spiral order is given by: 15 7 9 10 11 21 41 70 105 95 81 79 70 40 15 9 6 10 12 13 20 32 68 63 59 55 25 29 30

4. For a given matrix of N x M, print its transpose.
