## Write Java programs for the following:

1. Take an array of names as input from the user and print them on the screen.
2. Find the maximum & minimum number in an array of integers. [HINT : Read about Integer.MIN_VALUE & Integer.MAX_VALUE in Java]
3. Take an array of numbers as input and check if it is an array sorted in ascending order. Eg : { 1, 2, 4, 7 } is sorted in ascending order.
{3, 4, 6, 2} is not sorted in ascending order.
